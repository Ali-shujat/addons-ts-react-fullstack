# Salt React Fullstack - TypeScript Addon

## Task
Your task is to create a frontend to the API that you created the other day, aka `puppiesAPI`.
This is a good app to put in your portfolio, so even though it does not have any design requirements, make it look nice. The application should be built with React and TypeScript

Requirements for the UI:
- It should display the initial puppies that exist in the DB on first load.
- It should have the possibility to add a new puppy.
- It should have the possibility to update an existing puppy.
- It should display details when clicking on a selected puppy.
- It should be able to delete a puppy from the DB.

### Extra challenge
Fetch an image from Unsplash API (or similar) and aggregate the data in your own API to include the image with the rest of the puppy information.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
